\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
The true flavor, the real fun, the continuous excitement of work lie in the process of doing it rather than in having it over and done with. - The Wings of Fire.

I would like to thank all who have assisted and supported me through my research and the thesis compilation process.

I am especially thankful to Dr.~John R. Buck, my advisor, for his continual guidance throughout my research. He has always pushed me for improvement through his subtle encouragements and appreciations. As a result I feel prepared to undertake future research endeavors. 

I would also like to thank my lab colleagues Dave, Peter, Sudeep and Kaushallya who were always willing to listen to my research ideas and discuss possible solution approaches.

I am thankful to my parents, Sugat my brother, Matina my wife and all family members back home who have supported me all the way through this process. I always found myself filled with new energy after talking with family members during weekends. Their support has been an essential impetus for me during my research days.

I am also thankful to all the staff members of Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering for their help on administrative tasks. Finally I would like to acknowledge Office of Naval Research (ONR) for funding my PhD research.
