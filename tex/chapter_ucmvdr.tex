\chapter{Unit circle MVDR ABF}
\label{ch:ucmvdr}
The array polynomial is the $z$-transform of the array weights for a
narrowband planewave beamformer using a ULA as previously discussed in
\ref{sec:array-poly}. Evaluating the array polynomial on the unit
circle in the complex plane yields the beampattern. The locations of
the polynomial zeros on the unit circle indicate the locations of
beampattern nulls. For planewave signals measured with a ULA, the
locations of the ensemble MVDR polynomial zeros are constrained on the
unit circle \cite{steinhardt2004stap,tuladhar2015ucmvdr}. However, the
SMI MVDR polynomial zeros generally do not fall on the unit
circle. This chapter presents the unit circle MVDR (UC MVDR) ABF which
exploits the constraint on the ensemble MVDR polynomial zeros to
modify the SMI MVDR polynomial zeros. The UC MVDR ABF creates deeper
notches and lowers sidelobes on average compared to the SMI MVDR ABF
resulting in better interferer suppression and improved WNG. The first
part of the chapter presents the UC MVDR algorithm. The second part of
the chapter presents the numerical experiment results evaluating the
performance of the UC MVDR ABF. The last part of the chapter discusses
the UC MVDR ABF implementation in a snapshot deficient scenario and
the unit circle DMR ABF implementation. In the sequel, the SMI MVDR
polynomial zeros will be referred to as sample zeros and the ensemble
MVDR polynomial zeros will be referred to as ensemble zeros.

\section{UC MVDR ABF in snapshot deficient case}
\label{sec:uc-mvdr-snapshot-def}
This section presents one approach to implement the UC MVDR ABF in a
snapshot deficient scenario ($L < N$). The UC MVDR algorithm begins by
initially computing the SMI MVDR weights. However, when snapshot
deficient the SCM is not invertible and hence SMI MVDR ABF cannot be
directly implemented as mentioned in Ch.~\ref{ch:lit-rev}. One common
solution is to apply diagonal loading (DL) to the SCM to make it full
rank and hence invertible. The SMI MVDR weights are then computed
using the full rank DL SCM. The DL level can be chosen using one of the
approaches mentioned in \sect{}\ref{sec:ucbf-perf}. The previous
section discussed the effect of applying DL on the locations of the
sample zeros. When the DL level is small enough the
effect on the SMI MVDR polynomial zero locations is negligible.

In the snapshot deficient scenario, an alternative approach is to
choose a minimal DL level $\dlmin$ just enough to make the SCM
invertible and compute the SMI MVDR weights. The SMI MVDR weights
evaluated using the minimally loaded SCM can be seen as the closest
approximation to the SMI MVDR weights when just enough snapshots are
available ($L \approx N$) to obtain a full rank SCM without having to
apply DL. Following this alternative approach, the proposed
implementation of the UC MVDR ABF in snapshot deficient case begins
with a minimally loaded SCM used to compute the SMI MVDR
ABF. Subsequently the UC MVDR ABF weights are derived by projecting
the sample zeros onto the unit circle as described
previously.

\figurename{}~\ref{fig:ucmvdr-snapshot-deficient} evaluates the UC
MVDR ABF implemented for a $N = 11$ sensor ULA in two snapshot
deficient cases. The top panel corresponds to the case with $L = 10$
snapshots and the bottom panel corresponds to the case with $L = 5$
snapshots. In both panels, the solid magenta curve shows the
interferer output power ECDF graph for the UC MVDR ABF implemented
using a minimal DL level \mbox{$\dl_{min} = 10^{-8}$}. The dot-dashed
red curve shows the interferer output power ECDF graph for the DL MVDR
ABF. The DL level $\dl$ is chosen to match the average WNG with the UC
MVDR ABF. As described in \sect{}~\ref{sec:ucbf-perf}, finding the DL
level for the DL MVDR ABF involves first implementing the UC MVDR ABF
with minimal DL for all trials and computing the average WNG. The DL
level for DL MVDR is estimated iteratively to match average WNG
between the two ABFs. Following this approach, in the top panel use
$\dl = 0.1080$ and in the bottom panel uses $\dl = 0.5856$ for the DL
MVDR ABF. Comparison of the ECDF graphs show that in both snapshot
cases, the UC MVDR ABF exhibits higher probability of suppressing the
interferer compared to the DL MVDR ABF. This implies even in a
snapshot deficient case, on average the UC MVDR ABF implemented using
the minimal DL approach attenuates interferer better than the DL MVDR
ABF.

\section{ Unit Circle DMR ABF}
\label{sec:uc-mvdr-dmr}
As previously noted, the DMR ABF is another practical implementation
of the MVDR beamformer. The DMR ABF is almost always implemented using
the SCM. The DMR ABF replaces the SCM in \eqref{eq:mvdr-wt} with the
structured DMR SCM \eqref{eq:dmr-scm} to compute the DMR ABF
weights. The ensemble form of the DMR ABF is essentially the MVDR
beamformer in white background noise. Following a
similar approach as the UC MVDR ABF, a unit circle DMR (UC DMR) ABF is
derived by projecting the DMR polynomial zeros on the unit circle. The
difference from the UC MVDR ABF is that the SCM noise eigenvalues are
averaged implementing the unit circle constraint.
  
\figurename{}~\ref{fig:uc-mvdr-dmr-pout} compares the interferer
output power ECDF of the UC DMR ABF, the UC MVDR and the SMI MVDR
ABF. The ABFs are implemented using $N = 11$ sensor ULA and $L = 12$
snapshots. A single interferer with $40$ dB INR is present at
direction $\uinter = 3/N$. Knowing that only a single interferer is
present, the dominant subspace dimension for the DMR SCM equals to
one. The noise eigenvalue of the DMR SCM is averaged from the $10$
smallest eigenvalues of the SCM. In
\figurename{}\ref{fig:uc-mvdr-dmr-pout}, the top panel compares the
ECDF graphs of the UC MVDR, the UC DMR and the SMI MVDR
ABFs. Comparisons of the output power ECDF graphs show that the UC
MVDR ABF and the UC DMR ABF have comparable ability to suppress
interferer. As expected both the UC MVDR and the UC DMR ABFs perform
better than the SMI MVDR ABF. The bottom panel shows a scatter plot
where each dot marker denotes the WNG of the UC MVDR ABF against the
WNG of the UC DMR ABF. Examining the WNG scatter plot, the WNG of the
UC MVDR ABF is almost always lower than the WNG of the UC DMR ABF. The
WNG of the UC MVDR ABF exhibits high variability while the WNG of the
UC DMR ABF has almost no variability and on average comparable to the
optimal WNG of $N = 11$. Wage and Buck have shown that in case of a
signal strong interferer outside the main-lobe, the WNG of the DMR ABF
has low variability and on average the WNG is close to the optimal WNG
of $N$\cite{wage2013dmr}. The UC DMR ABF inherits the WNG behavior of
the DMR ABF. These results indicate that compared to the UC MVDR ABF,
the UC DMR ABF exhibits similar ability to suppress the interferer
and a better WNG performance. However, the UC DMR ABF is limited by
the need to determine the dominant subspace dimension before
implementing the ABF whereas the UC MVDR ABF is devoid of such prior
requirements.

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:ch3-summary}
This chapter presents the UC MVDR ABF which projects the SMI MVDR
polynomial zeros radially on the unit circle to create perfect nulls
in the beampattern. By moving the sample zeros to the
unit circle, the UC MVDR zeros satisfy the unit circle constraint on
the ensemble zeros and creates deeper beampattern notches in the
interferer directions. In a snapshot deficient scenario the UC MVDR
ABF is derived from a SMI MVDR ABF evaluated using a minimally loaded
SCM. Numerical simulations show that the UC MVDR ABF suppresses
interferer better than both the SMI MVDR and DL MVDR ABF. Comparing
the WNG of the ABFs shows that on average the UC MVDR ABF has
higher a WNG than the SMI MVDR. Also, the UC MVDR ABF interferer
suppression is comparable to the UC DMR ABF. However unlike the DL MVDR ABF and the UC DMR ABF both of which requires choosing a design parameter,
the UC MVDR is not constrained to such requirements.
