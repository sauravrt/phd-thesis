\chapter{Double zero MVDR ABF for notch broadening}
\label{ch:dzmvdr}
ABFs encounter interferer direction mismatch because of interferer
motion or limited sample support available to compute the SCM
\cite{vtree2002oap}. This mismatch results in a loss of interferer
suppression and degraded output performance. Notch broadening is a
robust beamforming technique to address interferer mismatch by
creating wider beampattern notch in the interferer direction. This
chapter presents a new ABF approach for notch broadening. The double
zero MVDR (DZ MVDR) ABF exploits the properties of the array
polynomial zeros to create broad notch in the interferer
direction. The DZ MVDR ABF assumes using a ULA similarly to the UC
MVDR ABF, but does not necessarily assume that the observed snapshots are
plane waves. The first two sections of this chapter introduces the
interferer mismatch problem and the notch broadening technique for
robust beamforming. \sect{}~\ref{sec:second-order-zeros} discusses the
behavior of ABF beampattern in the vicinity of a null.
\sect{}\ref{sec:double-zero-mvdr} describes the DZ MVDR
algorithm. \sect{}\ref{sec:results} presents results of experiments
evaluating the DZ MVDR ABF in both stationary and moving interferer
scenarios. The DZ MVDR ABF is compared with the SMI MVDR, the DL MVDR
and the CMT MVDR ABF.

\section{Interferer mismatch}
\label{sec:interferer-mismatch}
ABFs place sharp and deep notches in the expected interferer direction
to suppress interferer power at the output. However in applications
involving interferer motion or limited snapshot support, the ABFs
suffer from interferer mismatch, i.e., the expected interferer
direction is different from the true interferer direction
\cite{vtree2002oap, riba1997comm, baggeroer1999passive}. Due to this
mismatch in interferer direction, the ABFs place a deep notch in a
direction different from the true interferer direction. As a result,
the ABF produces a shallower notch in the true interferer direction
which does not sufficiently attenuate the interferer. Hence,
interferer direction mismatch results in degraded notch depth (ND) in
the interferer direction and subsequent loss of suppression.

In a dynamic environment, moving interferers may traverse several
resolution widths during the snapshot averaging interval
\cite{baggeroer1999passive}. The motion spreads the interferer power
into multiple eigenvalues of the SCM. The number of dominant
eigenvalues is approximately equal to the number of resolution width
($\resW$) traversed by the interferer
\cite{cox2000mrabf}. Effectively, a single source appears to split
into multiple spatially separate sources. This source splitting due to
interferer motion results in interferer direction mismatch when
implementing the SCM based ABFs. In a snapshot limited scenario
($L \approx N$), random matrix theory based analysis show that the
dominant eigenvectors of the SCM are biased estimates of the dominant
eigenvectors of the ECM \cite{paul2007asymptotics,
  benaych2011eigen}. When the observed snapshots consist of planewave
interferers in white background noise, the dominant eigenvectors
represent the interferers that need to be suppressed
\cite{vtree2002oap}. However, due to the biased estimate of the
dominant eigenvectors, an ABF implemented using the SCM suffers from
the interferer direction mismatch. As discussed above, the interferer
mismatch leads to degraded notch depth in the interferer direction and
subsequent loss of interferer power suppression using ABFs.

\section{Notch broadening}
\label{sec:notch-broadening}
Beampattern notch broadening is a robust beamforming technique that
addresses the interferer mismatch problem arising from interferer
motion and the limited snapshot condition \cite{vtree2002oap}. A broad
notch in the interferer direction can continue to suppress the
interferer even in the case of a mismatch. One approach to notch
broadening is covariance augmentation method which modifies the SCM
such that the resulting ABF creates broad interferer notches
\cite[Sec.~6.7.6]{vtree2002oap}. Riba et al. proposed a notch
broadening technique by modifying the SCM using a 'spreading matrix'
\cite{riba1997comm}. The beamformer was designed for mobile
communication environment with fast moving interferers. Zatman and
Mailloux independently proposed separate but related methods to
produce broad notches in the MVDR beampattern \cite{zatman1995null,
  mailloux1995null}. Both methods modify the SCM to introduce a
cluster of incoherent fictitious sources around each of the original
interferer direction. The fictitious sources are introduced by
modifying the SCM prior to computing the MVDR weights. The resulting
MVDR weights places a null in the vicinity of each fictitious source,
producing a wide notch region around the interferer direction. Later,
Guerci combined the two methods under the theory of covariance matrix
tapering (CMT) for notch broadening \cite{guerci1999cmt}. The CMT
approach uses a spatially tapered SCM to compute the MVDR ABF weights
which produces broad notches in the interferer direction. The CMT
approach for notch broadening is discussed in the next section.

Another approach is to impose constraints on the derivatives of the
beampattern in the interferer direction
\cite[Sec.~6.7.1.4]{vtree2002oap}. This approach computes the MVDR ABF
weights with the constraint of the derivative of the beampattern
function $\beampatu$ with respect to directional cosine $u$ set to a
specified value at the interferer direction $\uinter$. The derivative
constraint forces the beampattern at the interferer directions, i.e.,
the notches to be flatter and broader. Gershman used the
derivative constraint approach to produce notch broadening in the MVDR ABF
beampattern. Gershman's method sets the beampattern derivatives at all
the interferer directions to zero \cite{gershman1991synthesis}. The
method does not require \emph{a priori} knowledge of interferer
direction, however the method assumes either a high power interferer
or a large number of snapshots available to estimate the SCM
accurately. Such assumption of large snapshot support is suitable only
in electromagnetic waves based applications but is unrealistic in most
passive sonar applications \cite{baggeroer1999passive}.

\subsection{Covariance matrix tapering}
\label{sec:cmt}
Guerci proposed the CMT approach for notch broadening in ABF
beampatterns \cite{guerci1999cmt}. The CMT technique augments the SCM
using a taper matrix $\taperMat$ to generate the tapered SCM
$\sampCov_{\rm T} = \sampCov\circ\taperMat$, where $[\circ]$ denotes
the Hadamard matrix product. The taper matrix $\taperMat$ is a
positive semi-definite (p.s.d) matrix with all the main diagonal
entries equal to unity. The p.s.d taper matrix ensures that the
tapered SCM is also p.s.d and the unity diagonal entries ensures that
$\tr{\sampCov_{\rm T}} = \tr{\sampCov}$, i.e., the tapering conserves
the total input power in the SCM. The CMT MVDR ABF weight vector is
computed by replacing the ECM with the tapered SCM $\sampCov_{\rm T}$
in \eqref{eq:mvdr-wt}. The ABF weight vector computed using the
tapered SCM produces broad notches in the interferer direction
compared to the SMI MVDR ABF. The choice of the taper matrix
$\taperMat$ determines the shape and width of the broadened notch. The
simplest choice for the taper matrix $\taperMat$ has the entries,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:taper-mat}
[\taperMat]_{mn} = {\rm sinc}((m - n)\cmtW/2)  
\end{equation}
where the parameter $\cmtW$ defines the desired notch width in terms
of directional cosine. Using the taper matrix in \eqref{eq:taper-mat}
creates a uniform notch of width $\cmtW$ centered at the interferer
direction. Unlike the Zatman and Mailloux approach, the CMT approach
does not require prior knowledge of the interferer direction, but it
requires choosing the notch width parameter $\cmtW$ before
implementation. The choice of the width parameter depends on the
application environment which is usually unknown a priori. In a
passive sonar application scenario, Song suggests that an appropriate
choice for the notch width is equal to the resolution width for the
given array aperture, i.e., $\cmtW = 2/(N-1)$ \cite{song2003null}.

\figurename{}~\ref{fig:cmt-bp-pz} shows the log-magnitude beampattern
(top panel) and the polynomial zeros (bottom panel) of a CMT MVDR ABF
(solid green) implemented using $N = 11$ sensor ULA assuming the ECM
is known. A CBF beampattern (dotted black) is also shown for
reference. Two independent interferers are present at $\uinter = 3/N$
and $-5/N$ respectively as denoted by the vertical dashed lines in
beampattern and radial dashed lines in zeros plot. The CMT notch width
is set to $\cmtW = 2/(N-1)$. Examining the beampattern, the CMT MVDR
ABF produces broad notch at each interferer direction. The notch
broadening is achieved by clustering multiple beampattern nulls in the
vicinity of the interferer direction. Equivalently, the associated CMT
MVDR polynomial zeros cluster in the vicinity of a interferer
direction, as seen in the zeros plot. For a given interferer strength,
the number of zeros used to produce the notch broadening depends on
the notch width parameter $\cmtW$. The wider the notch width
required, more zeros per interferer are used to produce notch
broadening. In the \figurename{}~\ref{fig:cmt-pz}, the CMT MVDR ABF is
using four zeros per interferer to produce broad notches. However, as
seen in the beampattern the CMT MVDR ABF produces broad notches at the
cost of high sidelobes and wider mainlobe which reduces the WNG
[\sect{}~\ref{sec:wng}].

\subsubsection{CMT as spatial modulation}
\label{sec:cmt-as-spatial}

\srt{Added this section to discuss how eigenanalysis of taper matrix explains the usage of three DoF per interferer when $\cmtW = 2/(N-1)$.}

The CMT approach of augmenting the SCM with the taper matrix
$\taperMat$ in \eqref{eq:taper-mat} is equivalent to performing
spatial modulation of the observed snapshots. The spatial modulation
of the snapshot generates fictitious sources around the planewave
sources contained in the snapshot. The eigendecomposition of the taper
matrix is
$\taperMat = \sum_{n=1}^{N}\eval_n\taperevec_n\taperevec_n\herm$ where
$\taperevec_n$ is the $n\nth$ eigenvector and $\eval_n$ is the
associated eigenvalue such that
$\eval_1 \geq \eval_2 \geq \ldots \eval_N$. The number of significant
eigenvalues of the taper matrix in \eqref{eq:taper-mat} is
$\cmtW(N-1)/2 + 1$ \cite{song2003null}. Hence, for a notch width of
$W = 2/(N-1)$, the taper matrix $\taperMat$ has only two significant
eigenvalues. Using the eigendecomposition of $\taperMat$, the tapered
SCM is
\begin{align*}
  \sampCov_{T} &= \left( \frac{1}{L}\sum\limits_{\ell = 1}^{L}\datavec_{\ell}\datavec_{\ell}\herm \right) \circ \left( \sum\limits_{n=1}^{N}\eval_n\taperevec_n\taperevec_n\herm \right).\\
  \intertext{Considering only the two largest eigenvalues $\eval_1$ and $\eval_2$, and rearranging the terms,}
  \
   \sampCov_{T} &= \frac{1}{L}\sum\limits_{n=1}^{2}\eval_n\sum\limits_{\ell = 1}^{L}(\datavec_{\ell}\circ\taperevec_n)(\datavec_{\ell}\circ\taperevec_n)\herm\\
               &= \frac{1}{L}\sum\limits_{n=1}^{2}\eval_n\sum\limits_{\ell = 1}^{L}\modvec_{n\ell}\modvec_{n\ell}\herm \\
               &= \sum\limits_{n=1}^{2}\eval_n\sampCov_n
\end{align*}
where $\modvec_{n\ell} = (\datavec_{\ell}\circ\taperevec_n)$ is the
$\ell\nth$ snapshot modulated by $\taperevec_n$ and
$\sampCov_n$ is the SCM obtained by averaging the snapshots modulated
by $\taperevec_n$ for $n = 1, 2$. Hence, the tapered SCM
$\sampCov_{T}$ is a combination of $\sampCov_n$ weighted
by the eigenvalues ($\eval_n$) of the taper matrix.

\figurename{}~\ref{fig:cmt-eigenbeam} shows the magnitude of
eigenbeams of the first two principal eigenvectors $\taperevec_1$
(blue) and $\taperevec_2$ (green). The eigenbeam for $\taperevec_1$
has a single mainlobe in the broad side direction, identical to a CBF
beampattern steered to the broadside direction. This eigenbeam
indicates that snapshot modulation by $\taperevec_1$ keeps the
planewave signal in the snapshot, unchanged. However, the eigenbeam
for $\taperevec_2$ has two distinct peaks on either side of the
broadside direction. The two peaks in the eigenbeam indicates that
snapshot modulation by $\taperevec_2$ produces scaled copies of the
planewave signal in the snapshot, on either side of the signal
direction. In effect, the CMT operation using the taper matrix in
\eqref{eq:taper-mat} introduces a pair of fictitious sources on either
side of the interferer direction. Hence, an MVDR ABF implemented using
the tapered SCM $\sampCov_{T}$ places notch on either side of the
interferer direction, effectively producing broader notch as seen in
\figurename{}~\ref{fig:cmt-bp}. Consequently, the CMT MVDR ABF using
notch width $\cmtW = 2/(N-1)$ uses three degree of freedom (DoF) per
interferer to produce notch broadening.

\section{Properties of the beampattern near a  zero}
\label{sec:second-order-zeros}
Evaluating the array polynomial \eqref{eq:beampat-poly} on the unit
circle $z = e^{j\pi u}$ yields the beampattern in
\eqref{eq:beampatu}. The array polynomial $\beampolyz{}$ has $N - 1$
zeros in the complex plane and the zeros that fall on the unit circle
produce nulls in the beampattern. A first-order zero on the unit
circle produces a `sharp' null in the beampattern. The beampattern in
the neighborhood of a first-order null is linear in the directional
cosine $u$ \cite[Sec.~3.2.3]{vtree2002oap}\cite{Steinberg1976}. In contrast, the
second-order zeros (SOZ) produce flatter nulls in the beampattern. The
beampattern in the neighborhood of a second-order null is quadratic in
directional cosine $u$. \figurename{}~\ref{fig:mvdr-null-zero}
compares the MVDR beampattern magnitude in the neighborhood of a first-order
null (blue solid) and a second-order null (red dashed). The SOZ effectively
imposes a first derivative constraint on the beampattern which forces
the second-order null to be flatter compared to the sharp first-order
null.

As previously discussed, the ensemble MVDR beamformer places a
beampattern null in the neighborhood of the true interferer direction
to attenuate the interferer. The vertical dashed line in
\figurename{}~\ref{fig:mvdr-null-zero} denotes the interferer
direction $\uinter$. The interferer falls on the 'shoulder' of the
null where the first-order null creates a sharp notch whereas the
second-order null creates a deeper and broader notch. Any mismatch in
the interferer direction changes the ND at the interferer direction
$\uinter$. In case of a mismatch, the ND produced by the first-order
null exhibits greater variation compared to the second-order null
due to the linear and quadratic nature of their respective
beampatterns. As a result, the ND produced by the first-order null is
more sensitive to interferer direction mismatch compared to the ND
produced by the second-order null. The DZ MVDR ABF presented in the
next section exploits this property of a second-order null to produce
broader notches in the MVDR beampattern.

    null produced by the MVDR beamformer. The red dashed curve denotes
    a second order null in the same location.}

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:dzmvdr-summary}
In conclusion, this chapter presents the DZ MVDR ABF which produces
a broad notch in the beampattern in the interferer direction. The DZ
MVDR ABF doubles the array polynomial zeros of a subarray SMI MVDR ABF
to derive the weight vector. The DZ MVDR ABF with the inherent
subarray processing requires less computation compared to the SMI MVDR
ABF implemented using same sized ULA. But the gain from subarray
processing is at the cost of reduced DOF and a wider main-lobe than the
SMI MVDR or the DL MVDR ABFs. Numerical experiments show that the DZ
MVDR ABF suppresses interferers better than both the SMI MVDR and the
DL MVDR ABF in the multiple stationary interferer scenario. Comparison
of the WNG shows that on average the DZ MVDR ABF has higher WNG making
it less sensitive to parameter mismatch. In moving interferer
scenarios, the DZ MVDR ABF performance is comparable to the CMT MVDR
ABF with the width parameter set equal to the ULA resolution
width. But the CMT MVDR requires choosing the width parameter while
the DZ MVDR ABF does not require making prior choice of design
parameters.
